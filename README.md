# TDP-codes
TDP-code example dataset: Flower17
We show experimental settings of three partitions (two tasks, i.e., two scales of inputs for extracting VGG-19 features) on Flower17 datasets. 
Due to that the extracted deep CNN features are large, we can not upload them through github; authors can extract features by themselves, or contact me, then I will send you the extracted features through other ways. 


Running Instructions:
1. TDP_main_par1_t1_selftune.m is the main function for conducting Experiments on task 1 of partition 1 on Flower17 datasets.
2. after you run all these six functions, you can obtain specific numbers of recognition accuracy.
3. for multiple task optimization, the parameters from each single task should be used as the initializing parameters.
